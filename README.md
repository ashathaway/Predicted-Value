# Predicted-Value

This project is from my internship as a Data Scientist. This project is part of a larger project to predict the value of a customer. I used a light gradient boosted model to predict if a customer is going to increase insurance coverage. The data was pulled from several sources within the organization.

The project is in 'Predict-Value-ipynb'.
